# noglucrawl

Crawler to extract particular information from specified websites. 

It's probably misnamed since its really a scraper of certain data.

## Usage
Do not use.
While an `index` of a passed url and its children will work, nothing is done with the results, yet. As such, it's really not useful for anybody except me.

Hopefully, there will be a more meaningful implementation in the near future.
